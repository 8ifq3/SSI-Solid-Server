# community-server

Implementation of the Solid server.

The architecture is based on the description [here](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/solid-server-architecture).
We follow the Inrupt [coding standards](https://github.com/inrupt/public-documentation/blob/master/coding-conventions/javascript-coding-standards.md) where feasible.
An initial dummy implementation with some examples can be found [here](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/solid-server-ts).
